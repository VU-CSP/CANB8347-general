### GinSim 3.0
Boolean model of MAPK pathway and DNA damage response leading to different cell fates described in [`Literature/Grieco et al 2013.pdf`](https://github.com/VU-CSP/CANB8347/blob/main/Literature/Grieco%20et%20al%202013.pdf). The model is in the `GinSim` directory, which also has the GinSim java application that should be able to run directly on your computer. You can access it on GitHub [mapk-cancer-cell-fate-network ginsim model file](https://github.com/VU-CSP/CANB8347/blob/main/code/GinSim/pcbi.1003286.s004/MAPK_large_19june2013.zginml), on CellCollective.org as [mapk-cancer-cell-fate-network](https://research.cellcollective.org/?dashboard=true#module/7984:1/mapk-cancer-cell-fate-network/1) or from [Supp Dataset S4 in the online version of the Grieco paper](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article/file?type=supplementary&id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003286.s004)
