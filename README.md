### Class objectives
The goal of this class is to introduce you to topics in cancer systems biology and give you the tools to solve problems from a systems perspective.  

_This class is **NOT**_:  
1.	An introduction to bioinformatics (though we may consider some big datasets)  
2.	An introduction to python or programming in other languages. If you are unfamiliar with coding you are expected to learn on your own (there are plenty of online tutorials and resources for this) or to ask for assistance. We will be using python around mid to late February.  
3.	A deep dive into each topic. This class is meant to survey different methods and approaches used in systems biology, especially as applied to cancer. If you would like more resources or a deeper dive into any of the topics, please donâ€™t hesitate to ask.  
4.	A math class. We will use a little math (ODEs, especially), and a background in calculus would be really helpful with this. However, a math background is not expected for this course.  

By the end of the class, **you should have**:  
1.	An appreciation for how systems thinking is different from more traditional biology and how systems thinking can be used to better understand and treat various cancer types.  
2.	Learned how to use various tools common in systems biology analyses, such as network modeling, graph theory, machine learning, and ODE modeling/rule-based reactions.   
3.	An idea of where to get more information on topics specifically relevant to your own work.
